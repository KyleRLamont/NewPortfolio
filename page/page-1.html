            My name is Kyle LaMont. I am a 35 year old living in Seattle, WA. My pronouns are he/him. I have a 2 year old dog named Rory.

            <br/><br/>

            In my previous career, I worked with customers to resolve their issues in an insurance setting by reading policies and applying them to claims and issues. As a developer, I use this same sound logic and meticulousness to rapidly resolve issues and build pages.
